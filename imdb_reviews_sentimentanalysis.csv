1,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,negative
2,before making barbie greta gerwigsinglehandedly directed two filmslady bird andlittle women  both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue both were very very good given those credentials one may expect barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture  and well it isntthe fantasy comedy begins in barbie land a place where barbie played bymargot robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other barbies and occasionally kens the designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job recreating the mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection the introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly selfaware and presents a world where barbie can be anything  a president a physicist a journalist a lawyer or a mermaid much like with the original toys ken ryan gosling comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of barbies gazethe plot is set in motion when barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground what follows isthe wizard of oz journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a pinocchio storyline of the doll in the real worldif barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit  as promised by the trailer  it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofthe truman show orstranger than fiction  instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plotlines that are never fully realised what is the nature of the connection between a barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the real world what would happen if barbie were put back in the box why is gloria america ferrera the receptionist at the mattel headquarters and later barbies realworld companion depressed  and how is that eventually resolved why is glorias daughter sasha ariana greenblatt cross with her mother why does the board of mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes most importantly the crux of the thirdact conflict  set in barbie land now renamed kendom  contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitantstowards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles one side is presented as clueless and attentionseeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful the film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling while the denouement includes one of the films highlights the musical number im just ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensivebarbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors margot robbie is pitchperfect as barbie and ryan gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the charactersif only this were better written if only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth,positive
3,the quality the humor and the writing of the movie is fun for a while its quirky and its unique when they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes the movie is a miss the middle expositional phase of the movie i must say is a borethe movie was so close to being great but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialoguewhat could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end but i guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings,negative
4,as much as it pains me to give a movie called barbie a  out of  i have to do so it is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted i have to give the filmakers credit yes i am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer im a guy i like guy things hell i even enjoyed the battleship movie a few years ago an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film but i also like to experience other perspectives and man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades  pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours the humor the sets the acting and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect i dont agree with some of the points of the movie but again thats ok this movie wasnt designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women it is a noholdsbarred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were allowed to have real jobs and do the same things as men give me a well done film that is a blast to watch that makes you think and that was done from a place of creativity passion and attention to detail and ill call it what it is a  out of  masterpiece,positive
5,as a woman that grew up with barbie i was very excited for this movie i was curious to see how they would evolve the stereotypical barbie into something more but the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot i consider myself a proponent of gender equality and this aint the way to get itbarbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world giving women the power and leaving the kens as attractive accessories once ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies are brainwashed this happens suddenly and without much explanation the kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance and barbieland falls into disarraythe movies solution to this is for the barbies to give a lot of ted talks on the patriarchy fool the kens into war with each other and rule once again but isnt the point if gender equality equalitythe feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so thick more humor and nuance please the story gets lost the real world characters dont add much and not much changes in the endwhat was enjoyable was the acting the sets and of course the nostalgia,negative
6,it pains me to say it but i enjoyed this movie so much more then i was expecting to musical numbers humour there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoybright garish and somewhat kitsch those were my expectations and sure its a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows but what i wasnt expecting was for the film to be so engaging theres actually some real depth that i wasnt expecting that opening introduction that came as a major surprise and pretty much set the toneof course there are plenty of double entendres laughs that adults will enjoy kids will no doubt chuckle away tooim pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production its very well made creative design and visuals a lot of thought has gone into this greta gerwig did a great jobmargot robbie is glorious as barbie ryan gosling was great i thought the pair shared some terrific scenes real chemistry and plenty of cutting one linersgreat use of music everything fitted into the film so well,positive
7,the first reason to go see itits good fun its fairytale comedy over the top pastiche and it works it simply does margot robie and ryan gosling have great chemistry everybody sorta agrees on thatkids are probably not the target audience although if they would watch it they wouldnt be shocked or something they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenesthe second reason to go see itit really looks the part i am not into sets or costumes in particular at all but i was impressed with the fun world they had created it really looks fabulous and i really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finishthe third and best reason to go see iti am a dude and i honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife but i honestly did not expect this sugarcoated fairytale barbieworld to touch my heart in the end but it did what the whatthey somehow created a finale that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe you cant wish for more than that as a dude watching a barbie picture hellothe only reason against seeing itif you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women then better not go see it because all the men are hilarious loosers and whiners in this movie with a brilliant performance by ryan gosling as an insecure crybaby who just cant get barbie to love himfeared the worst but in the end i was pleasantly suprised its certainly not a brilliant movie but it is a perfect summer escape movie with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe,nuetral
8,i thought this would be so much different the ending made me feel sad and empty ken and barbie dont end up together and they made ken seem like a complete idiot actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie and im not a man but thats just not true it was depressing and sad and never the way barbie was created for i know a lot of people wont agree with me and thats okay but it was just pointless going to see it the only good thing is that the barbie aesthetic was beautifully donei just do not like the way they presented men its almost like they want women to turn against men which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people,negative
9,i dont know if i put spoilers in here i am super worn out haha so i will just put that i didi had no clue what this movie was like or about it just seemed like a strange different type of movie to me it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect it was nothing like thatthere were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me i felt weird knowing that there is no way i would bring a kid or teen to see thisthe movie is really all focused on political and gender views so that one totally surprised methere are points in which i kind of rolled my eyes a bit of the singing kind of went on there were also times that i was all tearythere are sexual references in this young kids would not understand but one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have and a specific thing ken does not have that was a bit strangethe end threw me off here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way yet at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots also something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were but unlike the way things seem to be in barbie land the women will be above all men i didnt really get that then what may be the last lines of the movie place barbie somewhere i didnt get the point of iti heard adults laughing repeatedly the kids that were their kind of sat silentthis is one of those movies that i cannot see every watching again but it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater also i dug the set design all the other stuff in the barbie world it was just cool to see,negative
10,i went to see this today everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp for two hours barbie kind of succeeds there i loved the costuming and sets of barbieland and margot robie is such a fantastic actress the perfect embodiment of the optimistic shecandoitall barbie ryan gosling was a scenestealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coatdespite all this the movie as a whole was disappointing as much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat the messaging is so on the nose spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain not that these scenes cant be funny or hit home the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks but a little subtlety could not have hurti also had issues with the differences between barbieland and the real world i can accept everyone in barbieland talking in what many term marvel speak if youve watched anything made in the past  years youll recognize it right away you know we make all these pop culture references like spiderman in the mcu with aliens and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because its so awkward that its funny oooor it was when it was novel and new years ago now its staler than a can of pepsi clear oh yeah i remember the s macarenathe barbies and kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance however the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite messy complicated not that charming why are they also talking like that it just feels lazyand then there are the existential themes margot robies barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise at the end she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning a decent theme too bad the movie never really delves into it its given lip service nothing moreit had some cute moments but honestly the end experience was meh the hype was more memorable than the finished product,negative
11,greta gerwig and noah baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into a screenplay gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitionsunfortunately the only major weakness of the film in my opinion also lies in the screenplay when dealing with larger societal issues it lacks depth and possibly understanding the observations work but the contextualization falls short the approach feels crude and superficial this creates a confusing overall impression as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing a film that is so intelligent funny and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of thingskey moments in the film such as the encounter with the inventor fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere the angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap there seems to be a lack of sensitivity as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligentlyany scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated rather than being convincing parts of a larger wholeoverall im not entirely sure what to make of the film on one hand i had a great time but on the other hand i left the screening with mixed feelingsmaking it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board with ryan gosling obviously standing out,nuetral

13,my year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though many of these different plot ideas couldve been good on their own they are just too confusing all togetheron a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good i loved seeing the plastic barbie houses lifesized the movie was also very funny at parts i just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,negative
14,i was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly i find myself really liking it quite a lotset in the colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives a perfect life every single day one day she shows signs of beinga human she decides to go to the real world to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againbarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer the set designs are eyecatching and on point as well both margot robbie and ryan gosling nailed their parts but it is gosling who mostly shinessomething im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the oscars most likely for best production design best costume design and probably best song for billie eilish that song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,positive
15,i walked out of the theatre thinking yeah i had a good time in that movie but as the day went on i kind had that ok that kebab probably wasnt a good ideathe film is stunning in its production design and creativity and margot robbie is perfectly cast as the stereotypical barbie for the most part the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portrayingwhen we strip away the outside world and all the messaging barbie and ken have a few poignant moments  barbie realising shes not as perfect as shes been made to believe or when ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being hes ever had in his life they also share a couple learning and growth moments which i thought would pay off at the end of the filmi dont know why but i was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality the barbie brand history controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world and what the future could be thats a lot of pressure for one film i knowhowever this film is absolutely not immune to the notsosubtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently in fact it embraces is so much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind barbie and slaps her on the backside in broad daylight in a crowded space in front of her boyfriend and this kind of portrayal of men in  appears to be how the film views the worldmaybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it but upon reflection i realise now its just kind of yuckbarbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world but offer and foster some ideas for change instead we receive divisive and meanspirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life and also flat feet and celluliteif you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit and dont take this film too seriously then maybe youll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this moviebut if you need to do that to enjoy something then you need to ask yourself why,positive
16,i do not usually write reviews but this is beyond description last time i wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time this is almost as bad at least gosling plays his part well but the story is abysmal if you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry then yes please do you will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow  nearly two hours long this was mindnumbing storytelling at its mediocre worst how many ways can i say do not go see it if you have a choice see anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated selfimportance if i could give it negative  stars i would,negative
17,wow this movie was a love letter to cinema from the kubrick reference at the opening to the soundstage being  real  no cgi for the sets there were dance sequences like in the olden days think grease and the costuming  wow the costuming greta gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way the casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderfulthe acting was perfection i loved seeing the variety of barbies on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary pg rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity there was one beach fight amongst the kens but thats not really violence compared to todays average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood usedi actually didnt like the ending at all and i was quite annoyed that rhea perlman played the creator of barbie but made two quips about the irs getting her for tax evasion  something ruth handler never dealt with her problem was with the sec after she had signed off on a positive mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter  hows that so tough to explainirregardless i want to see this movie again and again and again,positive
18,i watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes but i talked her into watching it  itll get better honey theyll be going into the real world soonwell it didnt get better after they went into the real world i feel like it was a better show in barbieland where it seemed more realisticthere isnt anything wrong with the acting or production but the script is weak particularly when they get to the real world people just dont act like that im disappointed for the actors i think they thought it would be a great movie however its much more of a letdown,negative
19,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,positive
20,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,negative
21,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for margot robbie  point for ryan gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,negative
22,wow i did not see this masterpiece coming and thats not a joke somehow greta gerwig took barbie and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell its crazy but wow does it work the story is very mature thinker of a plot once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional the production design is so on point the whole movie is pink everything but its never polarizing all the shades melt together in a very pleasing way and of course the cast margot robbie was born to play barbie and she hits a home run but ryan gosling this dude rocks as ken he knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head he steals every scene hes in and i would be so on board with a ken spinoff america ferrara and simu liu are also great in their respective roles but the cast overall is just perfect overall barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy sorry lego movies and an overall fantastic time at the movies,positive
23,mrs shullivan and i enjoyed about the first  minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various kens we agreed that ryan gosling appeared to be the main character and not barbiedont get me wrong both ryan gosling and margot robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of ken and barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the ryan gosling ken doll with an enhanced cgi eight  pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for ryan gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through barbies vision of the changing worldthe visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the s elvis films such as blue hawaii since barbie and elvis were popular icons within the same era the downside of the barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male ken dollsall in all it was a decent film not to be considered a future film classic nor a memorable ryan goslng or margot robbie performance worthy of an academy award but just like barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era it would not surprise me to see a tv producer turn this barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly  minute tv sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold mrs shullivan and my own attention fori give the film a decent  out of  imdb rating,nuetral
24,i played with barbies a lot as a kid so i thought this movie was going to be fun the trailer looked great i thought why not lets have a girls movie night kick back relax watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid but i was greatly let down really fast the movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is what a man is how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are there was nothing in the movie that made me laugh it all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling its definitely not a kids movie either i dont think they would understand half of it really wasnt happy with the movie,negative
25,i really enjoyed the first  minutes of the movie it was very upbeat positive and light however things soon became negative about    minutes into the movie i couldnt stand it barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer kens attitude was sour for the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityi bought tickets to this show a month ago and i saw it the day before the official opening day i was very excited about this movie and i was playing the music dua lipa song almost every day i was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive but the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing it was just too much the movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast i would have preferred a more shallow and fun barbie movie vs this barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,negative
26,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,negative

32,the first reason to go see itits good fun its fairytale comedy over the top pastiche and it works it simply does margot robie and ryan gosling have great chemistry everybody sorta agrees on thatkids are probably not the target audience although if they would watch it they wouldnt be shocked or something they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenesthe second reason to go see itit really looks the part i am not into sets or costumes in particular at all but i was impressed with the fun world they had created it really looks fabulous and i really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finishthe third and best reason to go see iti am a dude and i honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife but i honestly did not expect this sugarcoated fairytale barbieworld to touch my heart in the end but it did what the whatthey somehow created a finale that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe you cant wish for more than that as a dude watching a barbie picture hellothe only reason against seeing itif you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women then better not go see it because all the men are hilarious loosers and whiners in this movie with a brilliant performance by ryan gosling as an insecure crybaby who just cant get barbie to love himfeared the worst but in the end i was pleasantly suprised its certainly not a brilliant movie but it is a perfect summer escape movie with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe,positive
33,i thought this would be so much different the ending made me feel sad and empty ken and barbie dont end up together and they made ken seem like a complete idiot actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie and im not a man but thats just not true it was depressing and sad and never the way barbie was created for i know a lot of people wont agree with me and thats okay but it was just pointless going to see it the only good thing is that the barbie aesthetic was beautifully donei just do not like the way they presented men its almost like they want women to turn against men which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people,negative
34,i dont know if i put spoilers in here i am super worn out haha so i will just put that i didi had no clue what this movie was like or about it just seemed like a strange different type of movie to me it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect it was nothing like thatthere were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me i felt weird knowing that there is no way i would bring a kid or teen to see thisthe movie is really all focused on political and gender views so that one totally surprised methere are points in which i kind of rolled my eyes a bit of the singing kind of went on there were also times that i was all tearythere are sexual references in this young kids would not understand but one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have and a specific thing ken does not have that was a bit strangethe end threw me off here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way yet at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots also something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were but unlike the way things seem to be in barbie land the women will be above all men i didnt really get that then what may be the last lines of the movie place barbie somewhere i didnt get the point of iti heard adults laughing repeatedly the kids that were their kind of sat silentthis is one of those movies that i cannot see every watching again but it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater also i dug the set design all the other stuff in the barbie world it was just cool to see,negative
35,i went to see this today everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp for two hours barbie kind of succeeds there i loved the costuming and sets of barbieland and margot robie is such a fantastic actress the perfect embodiment of the optimistic shecandoitall barbie ryan gosling was a scenestealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coatdespite all this the movie as a whole was disappointing as much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat the messaging is so on the nose spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain not that these scenes cant be funny or hit home the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks but a little subtlety could not have hurti also had issues with the differences between barbieland and the real world i can accept everyone in barbieland talking in what many term marvel speak if youve watched anything made in the past  years youll recognize it right away you know we make all these pop culture references like spiderman in the mcu with aliens and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because its so awkward that its funny oooor it was when it was novel and new years ago now its staler than a can of pepsi clear oh yeah i remember the s macarenathe barbies and kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance however the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite messy complicated not that charming why are they also talking like that it just feels lazyand then there are the existential themes margot robies barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise at the end she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning a decent theme too bad the movie never really delves into it its given lip service nothing moreit had some cute moments but honestly the end experience was meh the hype was more memorable than the finished product,negative
36,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,positive
37,greta gerwig and noah baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into a screenplay gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitionsunfortunately the only major weakness of the film in my opinion also lies in the screenplay when dealing with larger societal issues it lacks depth and possibly understanding the observations work but the contextualization falls short the approach feels crude and superficial this creates a confusing overall impression as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing a film that is so intelligent funny and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of thingskey moments in the film such as the encounter with the inventor fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere the angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap there seems to be a lack of sensitivity as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligentlyany scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated rather than being convincing parts of a larger wholeoverall im not entirely sure what to make of the film on one hand i had a great time but on the other hand i left the screening with mixed feelingsmaking it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board with ryan gosling obviously standing out,negative
38,my year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though many of these different plot ideas couldve been good on their own they are just too confusing all togetheron a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good i loved seeing the plastic barbie houses lifesized the movie was also very funny at parts i just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,negative
39,i was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly i find myself really liking it quite a lotset in the colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives a perfect life every single day one day she shows signs of beinga human she decides to go to the real world to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againbarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer the set designs are eyecatching and on point as well both margot robbie and ryan gosling nailed their parts but it is gosling who mostly shinessomething im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the oscars most likely for best production design best costume design and probably best song for billie eilish that song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,positive
40,i walked out of the theatre thinking yeah i had a good time in that movie but as the day went on i kind had that ok that kebab probably wasnt a good ideathe film is stunning in its production design and creativity and margot robbie is perfectly cast as the stereotypical barbie for the most part the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portrayingwhen we strip away the outside world and all the messaging barbie and ken have a few poignant moments  barbie realising shes not as perfect as shes been made to believe or when ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being hes ever had in his life they also share a couple learning and growth moments which i thought would pay off at the end of the filmi dont know why but i was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality the barbie brand history controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world and what the future could be thats a lot of pressure for one film i knowhowever this film is absolutely not immune to the notsosubtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently in fact it embraces is so much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind barbie and slaps her on the backside in broad daylight in a crowded space in front of her boyfriend and this kind of portrayal of men in  appears to be how the film views the worldmaybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it but upon reflection i realise now its just kind of yuckbarbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world but offer and foster some ideas for change instead we receive divisive and meanspirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life and also flat feet and celluliteif you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit and dont take this film too seriously then maybe youll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this moviebut if you need to do that to enjoy something then you need to ask yourself why,nuetral
41,i do not usually write reviews but this is beyond description last time i wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time this is almost as bad at least gosling plays his part well but the story is abysmal if you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry then yes please do you will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow  nearly two hours long this was mindnumbing storytelling at its mediocre worst how many ways can i say do not go see it if you have a choice see anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated selfimportance if i could give it negative  stars i would,negative
42,wow this movie was a love letter to cinema from the kubrick reference at the opening to the soundstage being  real  no cgi for the sets there were dance sequences like in the olden days think grease and the costuming  wow the costuming greta gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way the casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderfulthe acting was perfection i loved seeing the variety of barbies on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary pg rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity there was one beach fight amongst the kens but thats not really violence compared to todays average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood usedi actually didnt like the ending at all and i was quite annoyed that rhea perlman played the creator of barbie but made two quips about the irs getting her for tax evasion  something ruth handler never dealt with her problem was with the sec after she had signed off on a positive mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter  hows that so tough to explainirregardless i want to see this movie again and again and again,positive
43,i watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes but i talked her into watching it  itll get better honey theyll be going into the real world soonwell it didnt get better after they went into the real world i feel like it was a better show in barbieland where it seemed more realisticthere isnt anything wrong with the acting or production but the script is weak particularly when they get to the real world people just dont act like that im disappointed for the actors i think they thought it would be a great movie however its much more of a letdown,negative
44,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,positive
45,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,negative
46,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for margot robbie  point for ryan gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,positive
47,wow i did not see this masterpiece coming and thats not a joke somehow greta gerwig took barbie and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell its crazy but wow does it work the story is very mature thinker of a plot once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional the production design is so on point the whole movie is pink everything but its never polarizing all the shades melt together in a very pleasing way and of course the cast margot robbie was born to play barbie and she hits a home run but ryan gosling this dude rocks as ken he knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head he steals every scene hes in and i would be so on board with a ken spinoff america ferrara and simu liu are also great in their respective roles but the cast overall is just perfect overall barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy sorry lego movies and an overall fantastic time at the movies,positive
48,mrs shullivan and i enjoyed about the first  minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various kens we agreed that ryan gosling appeared to be the main character and not barbiedont get me wrong both ryan gosling and margot robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of ken and barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the ryan gosling ken doll with an enhanced cgi eight  pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for ryan gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through barbies vision of the changing worldthe visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the s elvis films such as blue hawaii since barbie and elvis were popular icons within the same era the downside of the barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male ken dollsall in all it was a decent film not to be considered a future film classic nor a memorable ryan goslng or margot robbie performance worthy of an academy award but just like barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era it would not surprise me to see a tv producer turn this barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly  minute tv sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold mrs shullivan and my own attention fori give the film a decent  out of  imdb rating,nuetral
49,i played with barbies a lot as a kid so i thought this movie was going to be fun the trailer looked great i thought why not lets have a girls movie night kick back relax watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid but i was greatly let down really fast the movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is what a man is how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are there was nothing in the movie that made me laugh it all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling its definitely not a kids movie either i dont think they would understand half of it really wasnt happy with the movie,negative
50,i really enjoyed the first  minutes of the movie it was very upbeat positive and light however things soon became negative about    minutes into the movie i couldnt stand it barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer kens attitude was sour for the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityi bought tickets to this show a month ago and i saw it the day before the official opening day i was very excited about this movie and i was playing the music dua lipa song almost every day i was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive but the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing it was just too much the movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast i would have preferred a more shallow and fun barbie movie vs this barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,positive
51,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,nuetral
52,before making barbie greta gerwigsinglehandedly directed two filmslady bird andlittle women  both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue both were very very good given those credentials one may expect barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture  and well it isntthe fantasy comedy begins in barbie land a place where barbie played bymargot robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other barbies and occasionally kens the designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job recreating the mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection the introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly selfaware and presents a world where barbie can be anything  a president a physicist a journalist a lawyer or a mermaid much like with the original toys ken ryan gosling comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of barbies gazethe plot is set in motion when barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground what follows isthe wizard of oz journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a pinocchio storyline of the doll in the real worldif barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit  as promised by the trailer  it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofthe truman show orstranger than fiction  instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plotlines that are never fully realised what is the nature of the connection between a barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the real world what would happen if barbie were put back in the box why is gloria america ferrera the receptionist at the mattel headquarters and later barbies realworld companion depressed  and how is that eventually resolved why is glorias daughter sasha ariana greenblatt cross with her mother why does the board of mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes most importantly the crux of the thirdact conflict  set in barbie land now renamed kendom  contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitantstowards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles one side is presented as clueless and attentionseeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful the film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling while the denouement includes one of the films highlights the musical number im just ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensivebarbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors margot robbie is pitchperfect as barbie and ryan gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the charactersif only this were better written if only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth,negative
53,the quality the humor and the writing of the movie is fun for a while its quirky and its unique when they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes the movie is a miss the middle expositional phase of the movie i must say is a borethe movie was so close to being great but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialoguewhat could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end but i guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings,negative
54,as much as it pains me to give a movie called barbie a  out of  i have to do so it is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted i have to give the filmakers credit yes i am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer im a guy i like guy things hell i even enjoyed the battleship movie a few years ago an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film but i also like to experience other perspectives and man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades  pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours the humor the sets the acting and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect i dont agree with some of the points of the movie but again thats ok this movie wasnt designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women it is a noholdsbarred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were allowed to have real jobs and do the same things as men give me a well done film that is a blast to watch that makes you think and that was done from a place of creativity passion and attention to detail and ill call it what it is a  out of  masterpiece,positive

62,greta gerwig and noah baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into a screenplay gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitionsunfortunately the only major weakness of the film in my opinion also lies in the screenplay when dealing with larger societal issues it lacks depth and possibly understanding the observations work but the contextualization falls short the approach feels crude and superficial this creates a confusing overall impression as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing a film that is so intelligent funny and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of thingskey moments in the film such as the encounter with the inventor fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere the angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap there seems to be a lack of sensitivity as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligentlyany scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated rather than being convincing parts of a larger wholeoverall im not entirely sure what to make of the film on one hand i had a great time but on the other hand i left the screening with mixed feelingsmaking it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board with ryan gosling obviously standing out,nuetral
63,my year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though many of these different plot ideas couldve been good on their own they are just too confusing all togetheron a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good i loved seeing the plastic barbie houses lifesized the movie was also very funny at parts i just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,negative
64,i was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly i find myself really liking it quite a lotset in the colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives a perfect life every single day one day she shows signs of beinga human she decides to go to the real world to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againbarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer the set designs are eyecatching and on point as well both margot robbie and ryan gosling nailed their parts but it is gosling who mostly shinessomething im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the oscars most likely for best production design best costume design and probably best song for billie eilish that song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,positive
65,i walked out of the theatre thinking yeah i had a good time in that movie but as the day went on i kind had that ok that kebab probably wasnt a good ideathe film is stunning in its production design and creativity and margot robbie is perfectly cast as the stereotypical barbie for the most part the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portrayingwhen we strip away the outside world and all the messaging barbie and ken have a few poignant moments  barbie realising shes not as perfect as shes been made to believe or when ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being hes ever had in his life they also share a couple learning and growth moments which i thought would pay off at the end of the filmi dont know why but i was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality the barbie brand history controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world and what the future could be thats a lot of pressure for one film i knowhowever this film is absolutely not immune to the notsosubtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently in fact it embraces is so much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind barbie and slaps her on the backside in broad daylight in a crowded space in front of her boyfriend and this kind of portrayal of men in  appears to be how the film views the worldmaybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it but upon reflection i realise now its just kind of yuckbarbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world but offer and foster some ideas for change instead we receive divisive and meanspirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life and also flat feet and celluliteif you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit and dont take this film too seriously then maybe youll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this moviebut if you need to do that to enjoy something then you need to ask yourself why,positive
66,i do not usually write reviews but this is beyond description last time i wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time this is almost as bad at least gosling plays his part well but the story is abysmal if you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry then yes please do you will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow  nearly two hours long this was mindnumbing storytelling at its mediocre worst how many ways can i say do not go see it if you have a choice see anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated selfimportance if i could give it negative  stars i would,negative
67,wow this movie was a love letter to cinema from the kubrick reference at the opening to the soundstage being  real  no cgi for the sets there were dance sequences like in the olden days think grease and the costuming  wow the costuming greta gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way the casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderfulthe acting was perfection i loved seeing the variety of barbies on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary pg rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity there was one beach fight amongst the kens but thats not really violence compared to todays average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood usedi actually didnt like the ending at all and i was quite annoyed that rhea perlman played the creator of barbie but made two quips about the irs getting her for tax evasion  something ruth handler never dealt with her problem was with the sec after she had signed off on a positive mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter  hows that so tough to explainirregardless i want to see this movie again and again and again,positive
68,i watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes but i talked her into watching it  itll get better honey theyll be going into the real world soonwell it didnt get better after they went into the real world i feel like it was a better show in barbieland where it seemed more realisticthere isnt anything wrong with the acting or production but the script is weak particularly when they get to the real world people just dont act like that im disappointed for the actors i think they thought it would be a great movie however its much more of a letdown,negative
69,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,positive
70,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,negative
71,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for margot robbie  point for ryan gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,negative
72,wow i did not see this masterpiece coming and thats not a joke somehow greta gerwig took barbie and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell its crazy but wow does it work the story is very mature thinker of a plot once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional the production design is so on point the whole movie is pink everything but its never polarizing all the shades melt together in a very pleasing way and of course the cast margot robbie was born to play barbie and she hits a home run but ryan gosling this dude rocks as ken he knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head he steals every scene hes in and i would be so on board with a ken spinoff america ferrara and simu liu are also great in their respective roles but the cast overall is just perfect overall barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy sorry lego movies and an overall fantastic time at the movies,positive
73,mrs shullivan and i enjoyed about the first  minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various kens we agreed that ryan gosling appeared to be the main character and not barbiedont get me wrong both ryan gosling and margot robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of ken and barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the ryan gosling ken doll with an enhanced cgi eight  pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for ryan gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through barbies vision of the changing worldthe visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the s elvis films such as blue hawaii since barbie and elvis were popular icons within the same era the downside of the barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male ken dollsall in all it was a decent film not to be considered a future film classic nor a memorable ryan goslng or margot robbie performance worthy of an academy award but just like barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era it would not surprise me to see a tv producer turn this barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly  minute tv sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold mrs shullivan and my own attention fori give the film a decent  out of  imdb rating,negative
74,i played with barbies a lot as a kid so i thought this movie was going to be fun the trailer looked great i thought why not lets have a girls movie night kick back relax watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid but i was greatly let down really fast the movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is what a man is how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are there was nothing in the movie that made me laugh it all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling its definitely not a kids movie either i dont think they would understand half of it really wasnt happy with the movie,positive
75,i really enjoyed the first  minutes of the movie it was very upbeat positive and light however things soon became negative about    minutes into the movie i couldnt stand it barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer kens attitude was sour for the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityi bought tickets to this show a month ago and i saw it the day before the official opening day i was very excited about this movie and i was playing the music dua lipa song almost every day i was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive but the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing it was just too much the movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast i would have preferred a more shallow and fun barbie movie vs this barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,negative
76,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,nuetral
77,before making barbie greta gerwigsinglehandedly directed two filmslady bird andlittle women  both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue both were very very good given those credentials one may expect barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture  and well it isntthe fantasy comedy begins in barbie land a place where barbie played bymargot robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other barbies and occasionally kens the designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job recreating the mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection the introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly selfaware and presents a world where barbie can be anything  a president a physicist a journalist a lawyer or a mermaid much like with the original toys ken ryan gosling comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of barbies gazethe plot is set in motion when barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground what follows isthe wizard of oz journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a pinocchio storyline of the doll in the real worldif barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit  as promised by the trailer  it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofthe truman show orstranger than fiction  instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plotlines that are never fully realised what is the nature of the connection between a barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the real world what would happen if barbie were put back in the box why is gloria america ferrera the receptionist at the mattel headquarters and later barbies realworld companion depressed  and how is that eventually resolved why is glorias daughter sasha ariana greenblatt cross with her mother why does the board of mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes most importantly the crux of the thirdact conflict  set in barbie land now renamed kendom  contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitantstowards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles one side is presented as clueless and attentionseeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful the film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling while the denouement includes one of the films highlights the musical number im just ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensivebarbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors margot robbie is pitchperfect as barbie and ryan gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the charactersif only this were better written if only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth,negative
78,the quality the humor and the writing of the movie is fun for a while its quirky and its unique when they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes the movie is a miss the middle expositional phase of the movie i must say is a borethe movie was so close to being great but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialoguewhat could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end but i guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings,negative
79,as much as it pains me to give a movie called barbie a  out of  i have to do so it is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted i have to give the filmakers credit yes i am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer im a guy i like guy things hell i even enjoyed the battleship movie a few years ago an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film but i also like to experience other perspectives and man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades  pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours the humor the sets the acting and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect i dont agree with some of the points of the movie but again thats ok this movie wasnt designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women it is a noholdsbarred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were allowed to have real jobs and do the same things as men give me a well done film that is a blast to watch that makes you think and that was done from a place of creativity passion and attention to detail and ill call it what it is a  out of  masterpiece,nuetral
80,as a woman that grew up with barbie i was very excited for this movie i was curious to see how they would evolve the stereotypical barbie into something more but the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot i consider myself a proponent of gender equality and this aint the way to get itbarbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world giving women the power and leaving the kens as attractive accessories once ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies are brainwashed this happens suddenly and without much explanation the kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance and barbieland falls into disarraythe movies solution to this is for the barbies to give a lot of ted talks on the patriarchy fool the kens into war with each other and rule once again but isnt the point if gender equality equalitythe feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so thick more humor and nuance please the story gets lost the real world characters dont add much and not much changes in the endwhat was enjoyable was the acting the sets and of course the nostalgia,negative
81,it pains me to say it but i enjoyed this movie so much more then i was expecting to musical numbers humour there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoybright garish and somewhat kitsch those were my expectations and sure its a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows but what i wasnt expecting was for the film to be so engaging theres actually some real depth that i wasnt expecting that opening introduction that came as a major surprise and pretty much set the toneof course there are plenty of double entendres laughs that adults will enjoy kids will no doubt chuckle away tooim pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production its very well made creative design and visuals a lot of thought has gone into this greta gerwig did a great jobmargot robbie is glorious as barbie ryan gosling was great i thought the pair shared some terrific scenes real chemistry and plenty of cutting one linersgreat use of music everything fitted into the film so well,positive
82,the first reason to go see itits good fun its fairytale comedy over the top pastiche and it works it simply does margot robie and ryan gosling have great chemistry everybody sorta agrees on thatkids are probably not the target audience although if they would watch it they wouldnt be shocked or something they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenesthe second reason to go see itit really looks the part i am not into sets or costumes in particular at all but i was impressed with the fun world they had created it really looks fabulous and i really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finishthe third and best reason to go see iti am a dude and i honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife but i honestly did not expect this sugarcoated fairytale barbieworld to touch my heart in the end but it did what the whatthey somehow created a finale that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe you cant wish for more than that as a dude watching a barbie picture hellothe only reason against seeing itif you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women then better not go see it because all the men are hilarious loosers and whiners in this movie with a brilliant performance by ryan gosling as an insecure crybaby who just cant get barbie to love himfeared the worst but in the end i was pleasantly suprised its certainly not a brilliant movie but it is a perfect summer escape movie with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe,nuetral
83,i thought this would be so much different the ending made me feel sad and empty ken and barbie dont end up together and they made ken seem like a complete idiot actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie and im not a man but thats just not true it was depressing and sad and never the way barbie was created for i know a lot of people wont agree with me and thats okay but it was just pointless going to see it the only good thing is that the barbie aesthetic was beautifully donei just do not like the way they presented men its almost like they want women to turn against men which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people,negative
84,i dont know if i put spoilers in here i am super worn out haha so i will just put that i didi had no clue what this movie was like or about it just seemed like a strange different type of movie to me it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect it was nothing like thatthere were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me i felt weird knowing that there is no way i would bring a kid or teen to see thisthe movie is really all focused on political and gender views so that one totally surprised methere are points in which i kind of rolled my eyes a bit of the singing kind of went on there were also times that i was all tearythere are sexual references in this young kids would not understand but one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have and a specific thing ken does not have that was a bit strangethe end threw me off here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way yet at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots also something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were but unlike the way things seem to be in barbie land the women will be above all men i didnt really get that then what may be the last lines of the movie place barbie somewhere i didnt get the point of iti heard adults laughing repeatedly the kids that were their kind of sat silentthis is one of those movies that i cannot see every watching again but it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater also i dug the set design all the other stuff in the barbie world it was just cool to see,negative
85,i went to see this today everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp for two hours barbie kind of succeeds there i loved the costuming and sets of barbieland and margot robie is such a fantastic actress the perfect embodiment of the optimistic shecandoitall barbie ryan gosling was a scenestealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coatdespite all this the movie as a whole was disappointing as much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat the messaging is so on the nose spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain not that these scenes cant be funny or hit home the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks but a little subtlety could not have hurti also had issues with the differences between barbieland and the real world i can accept everyone in barbieland talking in what many term marvel speak if youve watched anything made in the past  years youll recognize it right away you know we make all these pop culture references like spiderman in the mcu with aliens and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because its so awkward that its funny oooor it was when it was novel and new years ago now its staler than a can of pepsi clear oh yeah i remember the s macarenathe barbies and kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance however the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite messy complicated not that charming why are they also talking like that it just feels lazyand then there are the existential themes margot robies barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise at the end she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning a decent theme too bad the movie never really delves into it its given lip service nothing moreit had some cute moments but honestly the end experience was meh the hype was more memorable than the finished product,negative

92,wow this movie was a love letter to cinema from the kubrick reference at the opening to the soundstage being  real  no cgi for the sets there were dance sequences like in the olden days think grease and the costuming  wow the costuming greta gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way the casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderfulthe acting was perfection i loved seeing the variety of barbies on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary pg rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity there was one beach fight amongst the kens but thats not really violence compared to todays average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood usedi actually didnt like the ending at all and i was quite annoyed that rhea perlman played the creator of barbie but made two quips about the irs getting her for tax evasion  something ruth handler never dealt with her problem was with the sec after she had signed off on a positive mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter  hows that so tough to explainirregardless i want to see this movie again and again and again,positive
93,i watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes but i talked her into watching it  itll get better honey theyll be going into the real world soonwell it didnt get better after they went into the real world i feel like it was a better show in barbieland where it seemed more realisticthere isnt anything wrong with the acting or production but the script is weak particularly when they get to the real world people just dont act like that im disappointed for the actors i think they thought it would be a great movie however its much more of a letdown,negative
94,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,positive
95,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,negative
96,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for margot robbie  point for ryan gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,negative
97,wow i did not see this masterpiece coming and thats not a joke somehow greta gerwig took barbie and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell its crazy but wow does it work the story is very mature thinker of a plot once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional the production design is so on point the whole movie is pink everything but its never polarizing all the shades melt together in a very pleasing way and of course the cast margot robbie was born to play barbie and she hits a home run but ryan gosling this dude rocks as ken he knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head he steals every scene hes in and i would be so on board with a ken spinoff america ferrara and simu liu are also great in their respective roles but the cast overall is just perfect overall barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy sorry lego movies and an overall fantastic time at the movies,positive
98,mrs shullivan and i enjoyed about the first  minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various kens we agreed that ryan gosling appeared to be the main character and not barbiedont get me wrong both ryan gosling and margot robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of ken and barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the ryan gosling ken doll with an enhanced cgi eight  pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for ryan gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through barbies vision of the changing worldthe visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the s elvis films such as blue hawaii since barbie and elvis were popular icons within the same era the downside of the barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male ken dollsall in all it was a decent film not to be considered a future film classic nor a memorable ryan goslng or margot robbie performance worthy of an academy award but just like barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era it would not surprise me to see a tv producer turn this barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly  minute tv sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold mrs shullivan and my own attention fori give the film a decent  out of  imdb rating,negative
99,i played with barbies a lot as a kid so i thought this movie was going to be fun the trailer looked great i thought why not lets have a girls movie night kick back relax watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid but i was greatly let down really fast the movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is what a man is how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are there was nothing in the movie that made me laugh it all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling its definitely not a kids movie either i dont think they would understand half of it really wasnt happy with the movie,positive
100,i was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly i find myself really liking it quite a lotset in the colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives a perfect life every single day one day she shows signs of beinga human she decides to go to the real world to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againbarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer the set designs are eyecatching and on point as well both margot robbie and ryan gosling nailed their parts but it is gosling who mostly shinessomething im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the oscars most likely for best production design best costume design and probably best song for billie eilish that song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,positive
